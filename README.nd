🛡️ Phishing Simulation Platform – Group Case Study

A complete end-to-end phishing simulation system designed for cybersecurity awareness, academic research, and controlled training environments.

This project integrates Gophish, a Flask credential-harvesting server, and an analytics dashboard to demonstrate how phishing attacks operate in real-world scenarios — safely and ethically.

📌 Overview

This case study simulates the full lifecycle of a phishing attack:

Gophish sends controlled phishing emails

User clicks the email and lands on a fake login page

Flask server captures the submitted credentials

Data is stored in a SQLite database

Dashboard visualizes anonymized results using Chart.js

✔ Built for education and training only
✔ No real credentials used
✔ Fully local and secure environment

🛠 Technologies Used
Tool / Technology	Purpose
Gophish	Phishing campaign creation, email delivery, tracking
Flask (Python)	Fake login page, credential collection, analytics dashboard
SQLite	Secure local database for captured results
HTML / CSS	Web templates and phishing pages
Chart.js	Data visualization
Mailtrap SMTP	Safe sandbox for sending phishing emails

🚀 Setup & Installation
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install flask requests


(No external DB required — SQLite is built-in)

2️⃣ Start Credential Collector
python app.py


Runs at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

3️⃣ Start Analytics Dashboard
python dashboard.py


Opens at: http://127.0.0.1:5001/

4️⃣ Configure Gophish

Use this landing page URL:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/?campaign={{.Campaign.Name}}


Use it in:
✔ Email button link
✔ Gophish “URL” field

Do NOT use {{.RID}} — it causes errors.

5️⃣ Launch the Phishing Campaign

✔ Set Mailtrap as SMTP
✔ Create recipients group
✔ Create email + landing page
✔ Launch & track from Gophish dashboard

📊 Dashboard Features
✔ Anonymized Analytics

Daily submission counts

Campaign-based stats

Summary metrics

✔ Secure Detail Table

Masked emails

Masked passwords

SHA-256 hashed identifiers

Timestamped records

Campaign name tracking

✔ CSV Export

Exports anonymized data only — safe for research or presentations.

🔒 Security & Ethics

This system is built with privacy and safety first:

No real credentials stored

Passwords always masked

Emails automatically obfuscated

Hashing via SHA-256

Local database only

Intended only for ethical training and simulations

Never use without explicit written authorization.

🚧 Common Issues & Fixes
1. Gophish “RID not found”

❌ Caused by incorrect use of {{.RID}}
✔ Fix: Only use {{.URL}} in email template

2. Email open/click not detected

✔ Use Mailtrap, as Gmail blocks tracking pixels

3. Data not visible in dashboard

Ensure URL contains:
?campaign={{.Campaign.Name}}

Ensure app.py is running

Ensure correct POST route in login page

📚 Use Cases

Cybersecurity awareness training

Organizational phishing simulations

Academic research case studies

Demonstrating social engineering workflows

Testing incident response procedures

📜 Disclaimer

This system is intended ONLY for:

✔ Ethical learning
✔ Internal training
