🛡️ Phishing Simulation Platform – Group Case Study

A complete end-to-end phishing simulation system designed for cybersecurity awareness and research purposes.

This project integrates Gophish, a Flask credential-harvesting server, and a visual analytics dashboard to demonstrate how phishing attacks operate in real-world environments — safely and ethically.

📌 Overview

This case study simulates a full phishing attack workflow:

Gophish sends controlled phishing emails

Users click the email link and land on a fake login portal

The Flask server securely captures submitted credentials

Data is stored in a SQLite database

A dashboard visualizes anonymized results using charts

The entire system is designed for education, research, and controlled cybersecurity assessments only.

🧩 Architecture
Gophish Email → Fake Login Page (Flask)

🛠 Technologies Used
Tool / Tech	Purpose
Gophish	Phishing campaign creation, email delivery, tracking
Flask (Python)	Login page, credential collection, dashboard
SQLite	Secure local database for results
HTML/CSS	Phishing page + email templates
Chart.js	Data visualization
Mailtrap (SMTP sandbox)	Safe testing of phishing emails

🚀 Setup & Installation
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install flask requests


(No external database server needed — SQLite is built-in.)

2️⃣ Start the Credential Collector
python app.py


Runs on:
👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000/

3️⃣ Start the Analytics Dashboard
python dashboard.py


Opens at:
👉 http://127.0.0.1:5001/

4️⃣ Configure Gophish

Landing Page URL (Important):

http://127.0.0.1:5000/?campaign={{.Campaign.Name}}


Use this in:

✔ Email button link
✔ Gophish "URL" field
✔ Avoid using {{.RID}} — causes template errors

5️⃣ Launch Phishing Campaign

Set sending profile (Mailtrap recommended)

Create group (recipient list)

Create email + landing page

Launch and monitor from Gophish dashboard

📊 Dashboard Features
✔ Anonymized Analytics

Submission counts for the last 30 days

Campaign-wise distribution

Summary metrics

✔ Secure Detail Table

Masked emails

Masked passwords

SHA-256 hashed identifiers

Timestamped entries

Campaign name tracking

✔ CSV Export

Safely exports anonymized submission data.

🔒 Security & Ethics

This project is built with security and privacy in mind:

Emails are masked

Passwords are never shown

All sensitive data hashed with SHA-256

Database stored locally

Intended only for ethical learning and simulations

Never deploy on real users without explicit written permission

🚧 Common Issues & Fixes
1. Gophish “RID not found” error

Cause: Email template uses {{.RID}} variable incorrectly
Fix: Use only:

{{.URL}}

2. Emails not showing as opened/clicked

Fix: Use Mailtrap — Gmail often blocks tracking pixels.

3. Data not appearing in dashboard

Fix:

Ensure landing page URL includes ?campaign={{.Campaign.Name}}

Ensure Flask collector (app.py) is running

📚 Use Cases

Demonstrating phishing attacks for awareness programs

Cybersecurity training

Academic case studies

Testing incident response processes

Research on phishing behaviour
